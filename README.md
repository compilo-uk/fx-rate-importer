# FX Rate Importer
A low-latent & concurrent importer for FX rates, which fetches real-time quotes and persists them in a Cassandra data store.

The importer is implemented using Scala's Fututre class to important the rates as quickly as possible, with minimum blocking operations.

The rates are retrieved from the [True FX API](http://www.truefx.com/), which offers free real-time FX quotes for major currency pairs.

## Usage / Examples

This library can be used to simply retrieve FX rates from the [True FX API](http://www.truefx.com/), or to persist them to an underlying Cassandra data store.

#### 1. Fetch Single FX Rate

```scala
import com.sharpe.capital.model.FxRate
import com.sharpe.capital.fetcher.RateFetcher
import com.sharpe.capital.fetcher.TrueFxFetcher

...

val fetcher: RateFetcher = new TrueFxFetcher()

var symbol = "AUD/USD"

var rate: FxRate = fetcher.getRateBySymbol(symbol)
```

#### 2. Fetch Many FX Rates

```scala
import com.sharpe.capital.model.FxRate
import com.sharpe.capital.fetcher.RateFetcher
import com.sharpe.capital.fetcher.TrueFxFetcher

...

val fetcher: RateFetcher = new TrueFxFetcher()

var symbols = Array[String]("AUD/USD", "GBP/USD", "EUR/USD")

var rates: Buffer[FxRate] = fetcher.getRatesBySymbols(symbols)
```

#### 3. Persist Single FX Rate
